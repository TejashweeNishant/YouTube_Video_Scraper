# 📊 YouTube Data Scraping and Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **scraping YouTube channel data** and performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to derive insights from the content performance.  
The workflow is split into **three Jupyter notebooks**, each handling a different stage of the pipeline — from scraping to cleaning to deep analysis.
